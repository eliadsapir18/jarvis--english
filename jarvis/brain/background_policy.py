"""Which providers work the user never asked for may bill.

Background work — memory curation, profile text, anything a timer or an event
starts rather than a user turn — must never become a surprise invoice. The
maintainer's rule (2026-09-30), after ~5 EUR vanished in three hours while
nobody was at the machine: **once a subscription is connected, background work
runs on subscriptions (and free local models) only.** When the subscription is
logged out, out of credit, rate limited or simply failing, the work waits and
retries later; it never slides onto a per-token API key.

"Connected" is deliberately sticky. A login probe answers for the moment it is
asked, and the moments that matter are exactly the bad ones: an expired OAuth
token, a CLI that crashed during the probe, a plan whose usage window is spent.
Before this module a single ``False``/``None`` probe emptied the subscription
set and every stored key rejoined the wiki chain. So a subscription seen
connected once keeps the install in subscription mode for
:data:`SUBSCRIPTION_MEMORY_S`; only a user who stays signed out for that long is
treated as a key-only install again.

An install that never connected a subscription is unaffected: its keys stay
usable for background work, so a single-key download keeps a working product
(AGENTS.md "any single key must work").

Provider membership comes from the provider cards' billing mode, never a name
list (AP-21), so a new subscription CLI or local runtime joins by shipping a
card.
