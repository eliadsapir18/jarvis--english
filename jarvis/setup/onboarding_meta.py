# Canonical step order — must match SETUP_STEP_IDS in the frontend
# (components/onboarding/setup/setupSteps.ts). Setup runs INSIDE the real app:
# each step opens the app's own place for the job (the API Keys page, the
# wake-word group in Settings) and points at it. The tour of the app runs
# AFTER the completion restart and is tracked separately
# (``tour_completed_at`` in jarvis.setup.state).
# Restart batching (maintainer mandate 2026-07-18): permissions and voice sit
# LAST, directly before ready, because both only take full effect after a
# relaunch — and onboarding already ends with one unconditional fresh restart
# (onboarding_routes._schedule_fresh_restart). Permissions precede voice so the
# macOS microphone grant exists before the wake-word group's microphone test.
